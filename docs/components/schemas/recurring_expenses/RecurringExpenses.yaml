      The name for the recurring expense.

      ℹ️ **Note**: This information is taken from the description section of a transaction and then normalized to provide you with an easy-to-read name. As such, sometimes the name will reflect the merchant the payment is made to (for example, Netflix.com), while for other recurring expenses, this could be something like "Monthly payment to John".
    example: Netflix
