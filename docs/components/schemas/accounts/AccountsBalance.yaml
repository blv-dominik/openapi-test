      The current balance is calculated differently according to the type of account.


      - **💰 Checking and saving accounts**:


      The user's account balance at the `collected_at` timestamp.

      - **💳 Credit cards**:


      The amount the user has spent in the current card billing period (see `credit_data.cutting_date` for information on when the current billing period finishes).

      - **🏡 Loan accounts**:


      The amount remaining to pay on the users's loan (same as `loan_data.outstanding_balance`).
    example: 5874.13
  available:
    type: number
    format: float
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      The balance that the account owner can use.

      - **💰 Checking and saving accounts**:


      The available balance may be different to the `current` balance due to pending transactions.

      - **💳 Credit cards**:


      The credit amount the user still has available for the current period. The amount is calculated as `credit_data.credit_limit` minus `balance.current`.

      - **🏡 Loan accounts**:


      The present value required to pay off the loan, as provided by the institution.


      **Note:** If the institution does not provide this value, we return `null`.
