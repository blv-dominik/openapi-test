      We do not recommend sending the authentication token in the same
      request as registering the user. See our [Handling multi-factor
      authentication](https://developers.belvo.com/docs/handling-2-factor-authentication)
      article for more information and best practices.

      - Use `single` to do ad hoc one-time POST requests for accounts,
      owners, and transactions.

      - Use `recurrent` to have Belvo access information on a recurrent
      basis so you always have fresh account, owner, balance, and transaction
      data.


      For more information, see our
      [Links](https://developers.belvo.com/docs/links-and-institutions#links)
      article.

  username_type:
    type: string
    description: >
      Type of document to be used as a username.


      Some banking institutions accept different documents to be used
      as the `username` to login. For example, the *Cédula de
      Ciudadanía*, *Cédula de Extranjería*, *Pasaporte'*, and so on.


      For banks that require a document to log in, you **must**
      provide the `username_type` parameter to specify which document
      is used when creating the link.


      ℹ️ To know which institutions require the `username_type`
      parameter, get the
      [details](https://developers.belvo.com/reference/detailinstitution)
      for the institution and check the `form_fields` array in the
      response.
