> üìò Support for partial display_name searches
> 
> When filtering by `display_name`, our API supports partial searches of at least one character in length. For example, if you use `display_name=Banco`, we'll return Banco Bradesco, Banco do Brasil, Bancolombia, Banco de Bogot√°, Banco Falabella, Hey Banco, and so on.
