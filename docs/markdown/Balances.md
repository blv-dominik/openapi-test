A **balance** represents the amount of funds available in a checking or savings account over a period of time.

<ul>
  <li>
    If your Balance request is not for a checking or savings account, we return
    an empty array.
  </li>
  <li>
    If we cannot calculate the balance for a given day within your requested
    period, the <code>balance</code> and <code>current_balance</code> fields
    will return <code>null</code> for that day.
  </li>
</ul>

> ðŸ“˜ 
> 
> Savings accounts that do not have any associated transactions (for example, some _poupanÃ§a_ accounts in Brazil) will not contain accurate Balance information. We do not recommend using the Balance endpoint for these types of accounts. 
> 
> Savings accounts vary from institution to institution, so we recommend that you first use our [Retrieve transactions for a link](https://developers.belvo.com/reference/retrievetransactions) request, adding the `account` in the request body, to see if the Savings account has any associated transactions.
