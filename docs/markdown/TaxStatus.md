Our **Tax status** endpoint lets you retrieve information about a person's or business's tax situation, according to the country's tax authority. 

- For SAT (Mexico), this information is extracted from the _Constancia de situaciÃ³n fiscal_ document.
- For DIAN (Colombia), this information is extracted from the _Registro Ãšnico Tributario_ document.
