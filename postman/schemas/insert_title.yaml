    # Introduction


    Belvo is an open banking API for Latin America that allows companies to
    access banking and fiscal information in a secure as well as agile way.


    Through our API, you can access:



    - **Bank information** such as account information, real-time

    balance, historical transactions, and account owner identification.


    - **Fiscal information** such as received and sent invoices and tax returns.

    In this API reference you'll find all the information you need about each


    endpoint and resource.

    ## Environment


    We currently offer three environments: sandbox, development, and

    production.



    When using our SDKs, make sure to use the **Alias** (and not the Base URL).



    | Environment | Purpose | Access |

    |-----------|-------|-------|

    | **Sandbox** | The [Sandbox
    environment](https://developers.belvo.com/docs/test-in-sandbox) is dedicated
    for your testing and development phases. In this environment, you can create
    links without real credentials and you can pull test data from all
    endpoints. **⚠️The sandbox environment is refreshed frequently and your test
    data can be updated or deleted.** | Base URL (cURL):
    https://sandbox.belvo.com/ <br><br>Alias (SDKs): sandbox|

    |**Development**|The Development environment is dedicated for testing with
    real credentials and institutions with real-world institutions. You can
    create up to 25 links for free in this environment.| Base URL (cURL):
    https://development.belvo.com/ <br><br>Alias (SDKs): development |

    | **Production** | The Production environment is dedicated for live
    applications with real connections to institutions. In this environment, you

    will need real credentials to create links and you will pull real data from
    the institutions.| Base URL (cURL): https://api.belvo.com/ <br><br>Alias

    (SDKs): production|



    For each environment, you'll need to [generate separate API

    keys](https://developers.belvo.com/docs/get-your-belvo-api-keys).



    ## Response codes



    We use the following HTTP status code in the response depending on the

    success or failure:



    | Status Code | Description |

    |-----------|-------|

    | `200` | ✅ **Success** - The content is available in the response body. |

    | `201` | ✅ **Success** - The content was created successfully on Belvo. |

    | `204` | ✅ **Success** - No content to return. |

    | `400` | ❌ **Bad Request Error** - Request returned an error, detail in
    content.|

    | `401` | ❌ **Unauthorized** - The Belvo credentials provided are not
    valid.|

    | `404` | ❌ **Not Found** - The resource you try to access cannot be found.|

    | `405` | ❌ **Method Not Allowed** - The HTTP method you are using is not
    accepted for this resource.|

    | `408` | ❌ **Request Timeout** - The request timed out and was terminated
    by the server.|

    | `428` | ❌ **MFA Token Required** - MFA token was required by the
    institution to connect. |

    | `500` | ❌ **Internal Server Error** - The detail of the error is available
    in the response body.|



    ## Error handling



    ### Error messages



    Belvo API errors are returned in JSON format. For example, an error might

    look like this:



    ```json


    [
        {
          "request_id": "a6e1c493d7a29d91aed4338e6fcf077d",
          "message": "This field is required.",
          "code": "required",
          "field": "link"
        }
    ]


    ```



    Typically, an error response will have the following parameters:


    - `request_id`: a unique ID for the request, you should share it with the

    Belvo support team for investigations.


    - `message`: human-readable description of the error.


    - `code`: a unique code for the error. Check the table below to see how to

    handle each error code.


    - `field` *(optional)*: The specific field in the request body that has an

    issue.




    ### Request identifier


    When you need help with a specific error, add the request identifier

    (`request_id`) in your message to the Belvo support team. This will speed up

    investigations and get you back up and running in no time at all.



    ### Error codes and troubleshooting



    For a full list of errors and how to troubleshoot them, please see our

    dedicated [Error handling

    articles](https://developers.belvo.com/docs/integration-overview#error-handling)

    in our DevPortal.

            - Use `single` to do ad hoc one-time POST requests for accounts,
            owners, and transactions.

            - Use `recurrent` to have Belvo access information on a recurrent
            basis so you always have fresh account, owner, balance, and
            transaction data.


            For more information, see our

            Some banking institutions accept different documents to be used as
            the `username` to login. For example, the *Cédula de Ciudadanía*,
            *Cédula de Extranjería*, *Pasaporte'*, and so on.


            For banks that require a document to log in, you **must** provide
            the `username_type` parameter to specify which document is used when
            creating the link.


            ℹ️ To know which institutions require the `username_type` parameter,
            get the
            [details](https://developers.belvo.com/reference/detailinstitution)
            for the institution and check the `form_fields` array in the

            The amount the user has spent in the current card billing period
            (see `credit_data.cutting_date` for information on when the current
            billing period finishes).

            The available balance may be different to the `current` balance due
            to pending transactions.

            - **💳 Credit cards**:


            The credit amount the user still has available for the current
            period. The amount is calculated as `credit_data.credit_limit` minus
            `balance.current`.

            - **🏡 Loan accounts**:


            The present value required to pay off the loan, as provided by the
            institution.


            **Note:** If the institution does not provide this value, we return

            <br> - `DISMISSED` <br> The fiscal institution has investigated the
            taxpayer and declared them innocent. <br> - `CONFIRMED` <br> The
            fiscal institution has confirmed that the taxpayer is guilty. <br> -
            `OVERTURNED` <br> The fiscal institution has reassessed a previously
            confirmed taxpayer and, based on new evidence, has taken the

    description: >-
      An **institution** is an entity that Belvo can access information from. It
      can be a:


      - bank institution, such as Banamex retail banking or HSBC business
      banking.

      - fiscal institution, such as the Servicio de Administración Tributaria
      (SAT) in Mexico.


      ![](https://files.readme.io/69a4676-Banking__Tax.png)


      You can see a complete list of institutions by either consulting our
      [Institutions article](https://developers.belvo.com/docs/institution) or
      making a List request to this endpoint.
  - name: Links
    description: >-
      A **Link** is a set of credentials associated to an end-user's access to
      an **institution**.


      <div style="background-color:#f4f6f8; border-left: 6px solid
      #808080;padding: 12px;margin-left: 25px; border-radius: 4px; margin-right:
      25px">

      <strong>Example: </strong> The username and password combination used to
      log in to an online banking application would be a link.

      </div>


      You will need to register a **Link** before accessing information from
      that specific end-user, such as account or transaction details.


      <div style="background-color:#f4f6f8; border-left: 6px solid
      #4CAF50;padding: 12px;margin-left: 25px; border-radius: 4px; margin-right:
      25px">

      <strong>Note: </strong> We recommend using our <a
      href="https://developers.belvo.com/docs/connect-widget"
      target="_blank">Connect Widget</a> to handle link creation and link status
      updates.

      </div>


      You have the possibility to register two types of links:


      ### Recurrent links (default)


      With recurrent links, Belvo automatically refreshes information weekly and
      notifies you via [Webhooks](https://developers.belvo.com/docs/webhooks) so
      you always have up-to-date data. Then, when you receive the webhook, you
      can make GET requests to the List or Detail endpoints to instantly access
      up-to-date information, without needing to connect to the institution.


      <img src="https://files.readme.io/7b6c0d4-Recurrent_Link_FLow.png"
      alt="fiscal-endpoints" width="950">


      You can also make POST calls directly to the institution, as with single
      links, as soon as the link is created. However, we recommend you follow
      the flow described above (waiting for the webhook event) for a more
      optimal experience.


      ### Single links


      Single links are used to perform ad hoc data access to accounts, owners,
      transactions, and so on. For example, you can use it when you want to do
      an underwriting process to assess risk before lending money.


      For single links, you have to perform POST calls to an institution **every
      time** you want to access fresh data.

  - name: Accounts
    description: >-
      An **account** is the representation of a bank account inside a financial
      institution. A user can have one or more accounts in an institution. 


      For example, one user (or link) can have a checking account, several
      credit cards, and a loan account.


      Querying for a user's account information is useful as you can get
      information regarding:


      - what types of accounts the user has

      - the balance for each account (savings, checking, credit card, loan, and
      so on)

      the most sense for your specific use case. 


      We take up to 90 days of transactional data from the user's checking,
      savings, loans, and credit card accounts to calculate the risk insights.


      If you need to know the currency of the account, do a GET Details to the
      Accounts endpoint (using the account ID you receive from in the accounts
      array of the response).
